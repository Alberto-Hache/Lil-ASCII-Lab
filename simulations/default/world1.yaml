# Simulation definition:
# These are the settings provided to the simulation:
# - world definition
# - tiles definition
# - blocks definition
# - agents definition

# CONSTANTS you can use as values in this file:
#
# Colors:
#   BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, GREEN, MAGENTA, RED, WHITE, YELLOW
#   will be replaced with their curses' indices.
# Intensity:
#   NORMAL, BRIGHT
#   will be replaced with their curses' indices.
#

# WORLD definition:
# This is what the simulated world will look like:
world:
  # Aspect:
  name: "Random Blox"  # Descriptive string.
  width: 20  # [number] Defining coordinate x from 0 to width - 1
  height: 15  # [number] Defining coordinate y from 0 to height - 1
  bg_color: BLACK  # Background color (BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, GREEN, MAGENTA, RED, WHITE, YELLOW).
  bg_intensity: NORMAL  # Applied to bg color (NORMAL, BRIGHT).
  # Execution:
  random_seed: null  # [number] Seed for reproducible runs (null for random).
  initial_pause: true  # [bool] Initiate world in 'pause' mode.
  pause_step: null  # [number] Pause at this step if not 'null'.
  exit_step: null  # [number] Exit world at this step ('null' for infinite loop).
  exit_if_empty: True # [bool] World will be exited if no more active agents.
  fps: 5  # Frames-Per-Second, i.e. number of time steps run per second ('None' for full-speed).
  # Layout:
  n_blocks_rnd: 0.4  # % of +/- randomness in number of blocks [0, 1]

# TILES definition:
# This is what tiles will look like:
tiles:
  name: "ground"  # [string] Descriptive string.
  aspect: "·"  # [character] A single Unicode character to represent the agent.
  color: BLUE  # One of these (BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, GREEN, MAGENTA, RED, WHITE, YELLOW).
  intensity: NORMAL  # Applied to color (NORMAL, BRIGHT).
  initial_position: null  # Its initial position (random if 'null').
  energy_effect: null  # Effect on an agent standing on tile.

# BLOCKS definition:
# This is what blocks will look like:
# Most settings work like tiles'.
blocks:

  - # Simple block. (NOTE the '-' character at line start!!)
    n_instances: 100  # number of blocks to create
    thing_settings:
      name: "block"
      aspect: "▢"
      color: BLUE
      intensity: BRIGHT
      initial_position: null

# AGENTS definition:
# This is the initial population of the world.
#
# Here's how each setting works:
#
#   n_instances: 5  # Number of instances to create.
#
#   thing_settings:  # Work like tiles' settings.
#     name: "Omi-II"  # Descriptive string.
#     aspect: "Ω"  # A single Unicode character to represent the agent.
#     color: CYAN  # One of these (BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, GREEN, MAGENTA, RED, WHITE, YELLOW).
#     intensity: BRIGHT  # Applied to color (NORMAL, BRIGHT).
#     initial_position: null  # Its initial position (random if 'null'). Applied to first instance only if n_instances > 1. 
#
#   energy_settings:
#     initial_energy: 100  # Initial energy assigned at start [>= 0].
#     maximum_energy: 110  # Maximum energy the agent can acquire [> 0].
#     bite_power: 5  # Amount of energy the agent can take with one bite [>= 0].
#     step_cost: -0.1  # Energy consumed on each world step regardless of action chosen [<= 0].
#     move_cost: -0.1  # Energy consumed for moving to an adjacent tile [<= 0].
#     recycling_type: NON_RECHARGEABLE # Dynamics ruling its energy losses and 'death' [NON_RECHARGEABLE, RECHARGEABLE, EVERLASTING, RESPAWNABLE].
#
#   ai_settings:
#     perception: full_info  # World -> AI input.
#         A function in ai.py to extract from the world and the agent itself
#         all the information an agent will need to make decisions based on its
#         'action' function.
#     action: wanderer2  # AI input -> Action.
#         A function in ai.py (similar to a 'policy' in RL) to select an action at each step
#         for the agent.
#     learning: no_learning  # Action, Reward -> New AI.
#         A function in ai.py that updates the policy of the agent
#         after trying some action based on experience.
