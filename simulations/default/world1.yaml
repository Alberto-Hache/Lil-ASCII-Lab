# Simulation definition:
# These are the settings provided to the simulation:
# - world definition
# - tiles definition
# - blocks definition
# - agents definition

# CONSTANTS you can use as values in this file:
#
# Colors:
#   BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, GREEN, MAGENTA, RED, WHITE, YELLOW
#   will be replaced with their curses' indices.
# Intensity:
#   NORMAL, BRIGHT
#   will be replaced with their curses' indices.
#

# WORLD definition:
# This is what the simulated world will look like:
world:
  # Aspect:
  name: "Random Blox"  # Descriptive string.
  width: 20  # Defining coordinate x from 0 to width - 1
  height: 15  # Defining coordinate y from 0 to height - 1
  bg_color: BLACK  # background color (see ui.py module).
  bg_intensity: NORMAL  # background intensity (see ui.py module).
  # Execution:
  random_seed: null  # Seed for reproducible runs (None for random).
  initial_pause: true  # Initiates world in 'pause' mode.
  pause_step: null  # World will be paused at that step if not 'None'.
  exit_step: null  # How long to run the world ('None' for infinite loop).
  fps: 5  # Frames-Per-Second, i.e. number of time steps run per second ('None' for full-speed).
  # Layout:
  n_blocks_rnd: 0.4  # % of +/- randomness in number of blocks [0, 1]

# TILES definition:
# This is what tiles will look like:
tiles:
  name: "ground"
  aspect: "·"
  color: BLUE
  intensity: NORMAL
  initial_position: null  # Its initial position (or RND). If 'n_instances' > 1, it will be used for the first one only.
  energy_effect: null  # Effect the tile has on an agent standing on it.

# BLOCKS definition:
# This is what blocks will look like:
blocks:

      bite_power: 5  # Amount of energy the agent can take with one bite [>= 0].
      step_cost: -0.1  # Energy consumed on each world step regardless of action chosen [<= 0].
      move_cost: -0.1  # Energy consumed for moving to an adjacent tile [<= 0].
